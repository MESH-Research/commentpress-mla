MLA Commentpress Theme
======================

This theme was developed for [_Literary Studies in the Digital Age_][1], 
part of [_MLA Commons_][2].

The source code of this theme is released under the GPLv2 (see LICENSE.txt). 
The images are included for reference but remain the property of the Modern

## Notes ##

This is a basic child theme for [*CommentPress Core*](https://github.com/IFBook/commentpress-core) which demonstrates how to override various stylistic elements of the *CommentPress Default Theme*. Use it as a "starter pack" for creating your own look and feel.

Please note: this child theme only works with the *CommentPress Default Theme* supplied with the *CommentPress Core* plugin. Please make sure that *CommentPress Core* is properly installed before using it.

## Installation ##

Please install and activate the theme by doing the following:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the theme's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/themes/commentpress-child`.
2. Activate the theme.
3. Visit settings pages and configure theme.

##### Important note for Multisite #####

If you want to use this theme **without network-activating *CommentPress Core*** then you will need to network-activate this theme despite it appearing in the "Broken" themes section of your Network Admin. To do so, you need to use the "Bulk Actions" dropdown. It will then appear as an available theme only on blogs that have *CommentPress Core* enabled. If you **have network-enabled *CommentPress Core***, then this theme will appear as normal.
